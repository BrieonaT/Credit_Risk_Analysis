## Overview
LendingClub is  a peer-to-peer lending services company. This analysis takes a look into their creditcard dataset in order to determine percent of credit risk for the company. To do this, several techniques have been used, and the results of this analysis determine which method is most effective for the companyâ€™s current dataset.

## Summary
In conclusion, the results show which are the most accurate and least accurate models to use. The most accurate model is the Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier, at a 0.93 or, 93% accuracy, whereas the rest of the techiques fall into the 60s-range. With this in mind, it's safe to say out of all the models, the Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier is the most accurate and the suggested one to use for this example.
